# Brain Stroke Classification Project

# Project Description:
According to the Center for Disease and Prevention (CDC) Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. Every 3.5 minutes, someone dies of stroke. This project uses  parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status to predict if a patient had a stroke. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

# Project Goal:
Discover drivers of stroke.
Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to predict weather or not a patient had a stroke.
Use findings to see what preventitave measures if any can be taken to prevent a stroke.

# Initial Thoughts:
My initial hypothesis is that hypertension driver of stroke.

# The Plan
    * Aquire data from Kaggle

    * Prepare data

    * Explore data in search of drivers of stroke

    * Answer the following initial questions:
        *
        *
        *

    * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
        * Evaluate models on train and validate data
        * Select the best model based on highest accuracy
        * Evaluate the best model on test data
        
    * Draw conclusions
